      "writer adam rifkin and director gore verbinski are the names chiefly responsible for this swill . \n",

      "whatever promise the film starts with soon deteriorates into boring dialogue , terrible overacting , and increasingly uninspired slapstick that becomes all sound and fury , signifying nothing . \n",
      "the script becomes so unspeakably bad that the best line poor lee evens can utter after another run in with the rodent is : \" i hate that mouse \" . \n",
